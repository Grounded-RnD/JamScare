# JamScare

JamScare is an IoT-based application designed to monitor and track heart conditions using a physical IoT device. This application aims to help individuals with heart conditions stay aware of their heart health through real-time monitoring and notifications.

## Features

- **Notification**: 
  - Via Panel: A panel installed at the user's home with lights indicating the user's condition (Green = Good, Yellow = Caution, Red = Danger). In case of a red light, a siren will sound to alert everyone at home.
  - Via Application: Notifications about the user's condition accessible to family members through the app.

- **Panic Button**: Special notifications in the app in case of emergency, providing information about the severity of the condition and the user's last known location.

- **Data Recording**: Stores and displays the user's heart rate history in a graphical format, allowing tracking of heart rate changes over time.
